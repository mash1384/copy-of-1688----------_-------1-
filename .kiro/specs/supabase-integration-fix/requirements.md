# Requirements Document

## Introduction

웹 애플리케이션에서 샘플데이터 로드, 완전초기화, 새상품등록, 매출등록 등의 핵심 기능들이 Supabase 데이터베이스와의 연동 문제로 인해 작동하지 않는 문제를 해결합니다. 이 문제는 RLS(Row Level Security) 정책, 인증 상태, 데이터베이스 함수, 그리고 클라이언트-서버 간 통신 오류와 관련이 있습니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully load sample data into the application, so that I can test and understand the application's functionality with realistic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "샘플 데이터 불러오기" button THEN the system SHALL create sample products, purchases, and sales data in the database
2. WHEN sample data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the loading progress
3. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL handle authentication gracefully and provide appropriate error messages
4. WHEN sample data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages to help diagnose the issue
5. WHEN sample data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI to display the new data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to completely reset all application data, so that I can start fresh with a clean database state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "완전 초기화" button THEN the system SHALL delete all user data including products, sales, purchases, and settings
2. WHEN data deletion is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and prevent multiple simultaneous operations
3. IF the deletion operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
4. WHEN data is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI to show empty state
5. WHEN deletion is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm the operation was successful

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register new products with their options, so that I can manage my inventory and track sales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a new product form THEN the system SHALL create the product and its options in the database
2. WHEN product creation is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the form and show loading state
3. IF product creation fails due to authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication error messages
4. IF product creation fails due to database constraints THEN the system SHALL show validation error messages
5. WHEN product is successfully created THEN the system SHALL add it to the products list and close the form
6. WHEN creating product options THEN the system SHALL ensure all options are properly linked to the parent product

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register sales transactions, so that I can track my revenue and update inventory levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a sales form THEN the system SHALL create the sale record and update inventory stock
2. WHEN a sale is being processed THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure data consistency
3. IF stock is insufficient THEN the system SHALL allow the sale but warn about negative inventory
4. IF the sale creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about what went wrong
5. WHEN sale is successfully created THEN the system SHALL update the sales list and refresh inventory displays
6. WHEN stock is updated THEN the system SHALL use the decrease_stock database function correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the application, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages while logging technical details
3. WHEN RLS policies block operations THEN the system SHALL detect and report policy-related issues
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network, authentication, and application errors
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and not crash the UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication states properly, so that all features work correctly when I'm logged in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN all database operations SHALL work with proper user context
2. WHEN the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
3. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login or show appropriate messages
4. WHEN user authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly
5. WHEN performing user-specific operations THEN the system SHALL ensure proper user ID association
